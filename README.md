# The-Sparks-Foundation-Internship

Welcome to the Readme file for my internship project with The Sparks Foundation. This project involved working on certain tasks 

## Task 1: Supervized Machine Learning Prediction Model
In this task it is required to predict the percentage of a student on the basis of number of hours studied using the Linear Regression supervised machine learning algorithm.
### Steps:

 1. Step 1 - Importing the libraries
 2. Step 2 - Importing the dataset
 3. Step 3 - EDA
 4. Step 4 - Feature Engineering
 5. Step 5 - Preparation of Data
 6. Step 6 - Model Prediction
 7. Step 7 - Performance Metrics


# Task 2: Unupervized Machine Learning Prediction Model
In this task it is required to predict the optimum number of cluster for the iris data set .iris data set consists of 3 types of flower namely Iris-setosa Iris-versicolour and Iris-virginica
### Steps:

 1. Step 1 - Importing the libraries
 2. Step 2 - Importing the dataset
 3. Step 3 - EDA
 4. Step 4 - Elbow Method
 5. Step 5 - Applying K means clustering algorithm
 6. Step 6 - Final clusters

# Task 4: EDA Terrorism
1-what is the hot zone of terrorism?

# Task 6: Decision Tree Classifier
-Develop decision tree algorithm and graph it
