# The-Spark-Foundation---// Supervised ML //---Task-1

In this section we will see how the Python Scikit-Learn library for machine learning can be used to implement regression functions. We will start with simple linear regression involving two variables.

This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.

# The-Spark-Foundation---// Unsupervised ML //---Task-2

In this section you will get a explanation of second task as well as difference between supervised and unsupervised ML. we have used 'iris' dataset here.

And we have predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.

# The-Spark-Foundation---// Exploratory Data Analysis - Terrorism //---Task-4

In this section, we have perform 'Exploratory Data Analysis - Terrorism' on dataset 'Global Terrorism'

We have found here hot zone of the terrorism. And analysed the data of INDIA.

you can run this code on your Jupyter notebook as well as Spider. 

And I have shared complete visualization part of the task using Matplotlib and Seaborn etc. And some more basic libraries like-pandas, numpy, warning etc.

**Conclusion ** 
1. Most attacks in Country - Iraq

2. Most attacks in City - Baghdad

3. Most attacks in Region - Middle East & North Africa

4. Least attacks in Region - Australasia & Oceania

5. Most attacks in year - 2014

6. Most attacks by Group - Taliban

7. Most attacks type - Bombing/Explsion

8. Most target type by terriorst - Private Citizens/Property



# The-Spark-Foundation---// Exploratory Data Analysis //---Task-6

In this task, we have Created the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.

The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.

Decision tree algorithms is the Supervised learning. The purpose of create the Decision tree classsifier is if we feed any new data in this classifier, it would be able to predict right class accordingly.The goal of using Decision tree is to create a training model that can use to predict the classes and value of the target variable by simple learning rules. And this algorithms can perform both classification, regression and multioutput tasks. let's check ans start with the iris dataset.

1. iris - setosa can easily be identified whereas the iris - versicolor & iris - virginics are overlapping.
2. Petal-length and Petal Width is important feature for identifying the flower
